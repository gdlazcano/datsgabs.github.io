[Murtuzaali Surti](https://twitter.com/murtuza_surti) submitted his blog [Syntackle](https://syntackle.live) for review on [a Twitter post I made](https://twitter.com/gdlazcano_/status/1557576403176112129).

## It's fast ‚ö°

The first thing I noticed was that the website was fast. I was able to **load it in less than a second**. This was later confirmed by [pagespeed insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/). It's made with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) and i'm gladly surprised that it's that fast.

## Clean design

The home page is clean and simple. The title of the article the description with a word limit, that looks really good, and the date of publication.

The post page it's even better. What can I say you simply look at it and know it's good design.

**And completely responsive**

## Dark mode/Light mode toggle ‚òÄÔ∏èüåô

The design in light mode is equally good and persistent using `localstorage`.

## RSS Feed

I always appreciate the addition of an RSS feed in a blog. It's a great way to keep track of the latest posts.

## Uses Webmentions üôåüôå

If you've read my post of [how I migrated from Disqus to Webmentions](https://gabriellazcano.com/blog/why-you-might-replace-disqus-with-webmentions/), you'll know that I actually quite like them and plan of using them from now on. In Murtuzaali's site he doesn't explicitly use them, but I think it'd be a good idea to do so.

## Great use of _meta tags_ and _semantic HTML_

This site has a great use of meta tags. He knows it's great to get the best SEO results.

Murtuzaali has done an amazing job at implementing semantic HTML. He uses main, article, header and footer tags making the website really accesisble.

## Oportunities for improvement

In desktop mode, the header is very spaced out and in big screens it doesn't seem quite right. Maybe it could be fixed to the width of the main container.

## Conclusion

It's pretty much what I expected. I'm glad I found this site. It might be missing some features, but something more is an addition it works perfectly as it is.

**9.8/10**
