## Introduction

So I decided to go into blogging, I've tried using the common blogging sites but being layed back by the tools they gave me wasn't appealing at all.

In this post I'm going to be explaining the stack I use to run this site and the things I noticed in the process. I'm going to be updating this page as I'm extending my stack.

## The stack

In this project I used one of the best tools for Static Site Generation, `Hugo`. It's crazy fast and you can customize almost everything. I know Hugo isn't the most famous but it's definitely one the most reliable. For the time being, I haven't seen much attention to the framework and I would like to start contributing to making it widespread.

### Set Up

For setting up your own blog there are two ways, using a theme or creating your own. I tried using a theme but in the end it wasn't fulfilling my needs. I think that the full customization of the themes can be a 2 sided sword, as modifying really anything is extremely difficult. Even more some themes do not have enough documentation and you have to guess how everything works. I get that themes are convenient for starting your site and for people that don't want to go through the mess but I felt it as I was feeling before choosing Hugo.

I will, in another occasion, of how to set up a theme in Hugo as, as I mentioned before, is extremely convenient.

You can go through the steps of starting your own site, as I did, in the [ gohugo.io documentation](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/)

## Hosting

For the hosting I'm currently using Github Pages. I set it up using a Github Action that automatically builds my site in another branch of the project.

## Custom domain 

At first I didn't know anything about how configuring a custom domain, I thought it was really straightforward and it kinda is but I had a huge problem setting it up. You can see how I did it in [this other post](/blog/how-custom-domain/)


## Wrap Up
I hope you will find this blog post useful and keep it handy for a quick reference. If you want to learn more about Hugo, web development, tips & tricks, please consider checking my other posts üòÅ
