I've been doing some things with Typescript lately, and I'm really liking it but setting it up is somewhat inconvenient mainly because you have to first compile it into JavaScript. And for a simple test I don't find it as seamless as I would like to.

For example, if I'm doing some challenge for [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/), or any other competitive programming platform. You can work around this using nodemon but still the results are not as good as you could get with [Quokka.js](https://quokkajs.com/).

I have it installed in VSCode and you get to see the results of the code you are writing as you are writing it and it shows it a very non intrusive way, without having a terminal opened.

You just have to search it in the extensions tab in VSCode.

> To start Quokka.js on a file just type `CTRL+k+q` or press `F1` and type Quokka and you'll see the options.

There's to be noted that there's a Pro version, but the community version has all the features I need.

Once you start using it, you'll see your code like this:

This is just something I learnt today and felt like sharing :))
